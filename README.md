Here is the live link of this project : https://virtual-memory-simulator-self.vercel.app/

I have created this virtual memory visualizer using JAVASCRIPT, REACT JS, TAILWIND CSS and deployed on vercel

What exactly it is: It is a viazualizer which helps to vizualize algorithms of page replacement (Operating system concept) (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)
It makes you vizialize:
                        1.FCFO = First Come First Out 
                        2.OPR = Optimal Page Replacement
                        3.LRU = Least Recently Used 
                        4.Most Recently Used 

How to use: 
  By Clicking on How to use You can have an idea about how to use it:
  Reference String: Enter numbers [0-9] separated with commas

Frame Number: Enter number [3-7]
Generate String: Generate 24 random numbers
Show/Hide swapped out memory: Toggle illustration
Turn on/off animation: Toggle animation
Page Fault: 'F' indicates a page fault in a frame


On clicking 'Generate String' , it automaticaly generates a random referenfe string of 24 numbers ranging 0-9 and shows all 4 algos vizualization
